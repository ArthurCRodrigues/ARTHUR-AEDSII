# Stacks 
The stack is a linear data structure that works like a pile of plates. 
### LIFO (First In First Out)
The last plate to be placed is also the first to be taken out. 
It means that the element that is inserted last, comes out first.
### FILO (First in Last Out)
Implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

## Key Operations 
- **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removes the top element from the stack.
- **Peek:** Returns the top element without removig it.
