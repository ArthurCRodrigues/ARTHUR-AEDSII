# Bubble Sort 

## How it works:
Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they're in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the array is sorted.

## Steps:
 - Traverse the array
 - Compare adjacent elements, and if they are in the wrong order, swap them.
  - Repeat this process for every element, reducing the range with each pass, since the largest element will bubble to its correct position after each full pass

## Time Complexity:
 - **Best case**: O(n) (if the array is already sorted and optmized)
  - **Worst case**: O(n²)
  - **Average case**: O(n²)

## Stability: 
 - **Stable**: Bubble sort maintains the relative order of equal elements
